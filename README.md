# AtliQ Hardware Business Insights

## Project Overview
This is an end-to-end data analysis and Power BI project based on an imaginary company called AtliQ Hardware. AtliQ Hardware manufactures and sells hardware like PCs, mice, printers, etc., to multiple companies worldwide. These customers are of two types - physical stores and e-commerce platforms. AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding company, is struggling to do good business in Latin America. So far, all the decisions that AtliQ took have been based on some surveys and intuitions. Now, they have decided to implement data analytics using Power BI in their company for the first time to make data-driven decisions.
